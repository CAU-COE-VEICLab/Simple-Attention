This is the code base for **`"CS-Net: Conv-Simpleformer Network for agricultural image segmentation"`**

## Abstract
The agricultural industry faces numerous challenges, including incomplete sensor networks, long image acquisition cycles, and poor image quality, resulting in limited prediction accuracy and inadequate generality of conventional semantic segmentation models. To address this, we propose Conv-Simpleformer Network (CS-Net), which fuses CNN and Transformer. **`A lightweight Simple-Attention Block (SIAB) is designed to solve the problem of quadratic correlation between the computational complexity of Self-Attention and image size`**. **`SIAB uses channel-by-channel and spatial convolution computation, and its computational complexity is linearly related to image size`**. Additionally, this study cascades an FFN after SIAB to form a Simpleformer block, enhancing its spatial modeling capability. Finally, we performed comparison and ablation experiments on agricultural image datasets. The experimental results showcase CS-Net's superiority over other control models across various agricultural image segmentation tasks. The cascaded CNN and Simpleformer blocks effectively harness SIAB's potential to extract deep features and uncover hidden connections between targets.
